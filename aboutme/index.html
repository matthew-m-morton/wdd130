    <h2>Matthew Morton</h2>

    <p>Hello, My name is Matthew Morton. I was born in American Fork, Utah. Then when I was only a couple months old my family moved to Meridian, Idaho.
        There I spent the next 17ish years building character. I then spent a year as an electrician while I prepared to go on a mission. I servered my 
        mission in the Colorado Denver North Mission from 2019-2021. Now I'm here at college.</p>
    
    <p>This is my 5th semester here at BYUI. I am a CIT major with a focus in cybersecurity. This is my second time trying to take this class. 
        Last fall I had planned to take this class, but I was taking python and networking so I decided to not try and
        learn three languages at the same time.</p> 

    <p>I love to play disk golf. I love video games. I am currently playing Elder Scrolls V: Skrim, 
        Valhiem, and Legend of Zelda Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. I'm also super excited for the new Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom 
        that is coming out next May. </p>
    
    <p>This last summer I worked at a gun manufacturer making AR-15s. I know a lot more about guns now which is really cool. </p>
